## Content
This repository contains the source files needed to run some test cases for the
1D simulation of the hemodynamics in a vessels network.
Those files are supposed to be used within the **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**
(/,laɪfˈɛks/) library.

## Get the software
First, get the software. If you have already it insalled, skip to the next section.
Otherwise, to download, install or use **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**, please
refer to the [user guide and documentation](https://lifex.gitlab.io/lifex/).

## Usage
Download this folder **<kbd>vessels_network_1D</kbd>**
with its content at the following path:
```
<path_to_lifex>/lifex/examples/
```
Now compile the code by typing in the command line:
```
make -j<N>
```

## Test cases
To run some test cases, go to this [link](https://github.com/GiacomoLorenzon/vascular_hemodynamics_test_cases.git)
and follow the instructions.

## Referencing **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**
If you use the results obtained with the help of **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**,
please cite [this](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.14668) reference or one of the 
publications listed [here](https://lifex.gitlab.io/lifex/publications.html).
